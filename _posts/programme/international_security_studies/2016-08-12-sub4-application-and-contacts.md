What motivates me?

I think that more people should be interested in international security as peace and stability are the foundations for international cooperation and prosperity. For my generation the merits of globalization are taken for granted. Today most places on earth are save to travel and our daily lives are enriched by the cultural diversity that the free-trade of people and goods has introduced. Therefore, I take pleasure in working with young professionals who want to make contributing to international security their profession.

What motivates me?

As a student of literature, political science and history at the end of the 1980 I was fascinated that no one predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union and wanted to learn more about the reasons for this historic change. This is how I ended up in the security field. As a professor I soon experienced the huge demand for security experts in Europe but until recent years higher education in security studies was only available in the United Kingdom or the United states. That is why I came up with the idea to establish a Master’s program in International Security Studies at George C. Marshall Center and the Universität der Bundeswehr in Germany.
