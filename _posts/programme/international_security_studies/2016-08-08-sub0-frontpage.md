### The Master in International Security Studies (MISS)

### M.A. International Security Studies

**The Master of Arts in International Security Studies (MISS) is a unique post-graduate program for security professionals offered jointly by the Universität der Bundeswehr München (UniBwM) and the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies (GCMC). The one-year program is designed to prepare international military and civilian students with some years of professional experience for executive positions in the public and private sector.**

MISS participants profit from the particular strengths of the partnering institutions: The program combines university modules taught by the UniBwM professors and selected international faculty with the policy-oriented programs of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, a German-American defense institution where students study alongside other government officials from 110 countries. It provides its students with a comprehensive understanding of international security and connects them to a network of more than 10,000 security professionals around the globe.

Four different study concentrations – Regional Security, Counterterrorism, Cyber Security, and Countering Organized Crime – offer students an opportunity to deepen their understanding and develop professional networks in their specific area of expertise.

The program is designed for full- and part-time studies and can be completed either as a twelve-month course starting in September or by attending modules individually over a duration of two years. The entire program takes place at the Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a mountain resort in Southern Bavaria.
